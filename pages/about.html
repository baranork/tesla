                <h3>Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to
                    compromise to drive
                    electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars.
                    Today, Tesla
                    builds
                    not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage
                    products. Tesla
                    believes
                    the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the
                    better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Launched in 2008, the <a href="#">Roadster</a> unveiled Tesla’s cutting-edge battery technology and
                    electric
                    powertrain. From there,
                    Tesla designed the world’s first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up – <a
                        href="models.html">Model
                        S</a> – which has become the
                    best car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Model S has
                    reset the
                    world’s
                    expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle,
                    over-the-air software
                    updates that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as
                    measured by Motor
                    Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its product line with <a href="#">Model X</a>, the safest, quickest
                    and
                    most capable
                    sport utility
                    vehicle in history that holds 5-star safety ratings across every category from the National Highway
                    Traffic Safety
                    Administration. Completing CEO Elon Musk’s “Secret Master Plan,” in 2016, Tesla introduced <a
                        href="#">Model
                        3</a>,
                    a low-priced,
                    high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017. Soon after, Tesla unveiled the safest,
                    most
                    comfortable
                    truck ever – Tesla Semi – which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles
                    based
                    on fuel
                    costs
                    alone.
                </p>
                <p>All Tesla vehicles are produced at its factory in Fremont, California, where the vast majority of the
                    vehicle’s
                    components are also made. To achieve our goal of having the safest factories in the world, Tesla is
                    taking a
                    proactive
                    approach to safety, requiring production employees to participate in a multi-day training program
                    before
                    ever
                    setting
                    foot on the factory floor. From there, Tesla continues to provide on-the-job training and track
                    performance daily so
                    that improvements can be made quickly. The result is that Tesla’s safety rate continues to improve
                    while
                    Model 3
                    production ramps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Tesla also manufactures a unique set of energy
                    solutions,
                    Powerwall,
                    Powerpack and Solar Roof, enabling homeowners, businesses, and utilities to manage renewable energy
                    generation,
                    storage,
                    and consumption. Supporting Tesla’s automotive and energy products is Gigafactory 1 – a facility
                    designed to
                    significantly reduce battery cell costs. By bringing cell production in-house, Tesla manufactures
                    batteries at the
                    volumes required to meet production goals, while creating thousands of jobs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues to
                    make
                    products
                    accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean
                    transport
                    and clean
                    energy production. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage already
                    exist
                    independently,
                    but when combined, they become even more powerful – that’s the future we want.
